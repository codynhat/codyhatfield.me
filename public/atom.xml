    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/ev-road-trip-for-the-fun-of-it/images/teton-tesla-model-3-dashcam.png" title="Grand Tetons from Model 3 Dashcam"><p>I recently drove a 2700 mile road trip alone with my electric vehicle: a Tesla Model 3. Many people have asked me why I would want to drive from Seattle, Washington to Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Even my own family members chose flying over riding with me. Someone even asked if the gas was more expensive than a plane ticket üòè.</p><p>There is quite a bit of information and opinions out there about electric vehicles. I have had my Model 3 for almost a year and many people have asked me questions about my experience. People are always very curious, yet the questions they ask tell me that most people do not know enough about electric vehicles. Even with all the information out there people are having their fears blown way out of proportion, are being misled, and even have outright false information.</p><p>This is why I chose to drive 2700 miles instead of buying a plane ticket. We are all overwhelmed with information these days. Information coming from the first-hand experience of someone you know will be more memorable than misleading articles you see online. I hope to share my experience with the people I know, so they may start asking different questions. Our planet and future generations depend on it.</p><hr><h2 id="Benefits-What-benefits"><a href="#Benefits-What-benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits? What benefits?"></a>Benefits? What benefits?</h2><p>There is, of course, another reason I deciding to pass on the plane ticket. <strong>Electric vehicles are just fun to drive.</strong> There is no other way to put it. I would choose driving my car over any other form of transportation in almost any scenario.</p><p>The questions people ask are always about common concerns with electric vehicles. They never ask about the benefits. What I have come to realize is most people do not know what the benefits are, yet even realize they exist. The pros-and-cons list in people‚Äôs heads looks something like this:</p><img src="/ev-road-trip-for-the-fun-of-it/images/pros-cons.png" title="Perceived EV Pros and Cons"><p>This is completely normal. Electric vehicles are new and different. <strong>We are scared of what is different and tend to focus on it.</strong> People were skeptical of the original iPhone because it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/regarding_the_iphone_keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn‚Äôt have a keyboard</a>. Whoa, different. Scary. Does anyone remember using a phone with a physical keyboard?</p><p>Electric vehicles are currently seen as a compromise. They are better for the environment, but I have to give up <em>a lot</em> to have one, right? Well, let‚Äôs spend some time looking at that other list that people tend to forget.</p><p>More specifically, I would like to share some benefits I experienced throughout my road trip, many of which I experienced for the first time.</p><h2 id="Cost-of-fuel"><a href="#Cost-of-fuel" class="headerlink" title="Cost of fuel"></a>Cost of fuel</h2><p>I will start by getting this out of the way. Most people I talk with understand this benefit pretty well. In fact, most see it as basically the only benefit. Nevertheless, it is always great to see some real-world data. <strong>How much cheaper is an EV road trip compared to the same road trip in a internal combustion engine (ICE) car?</strong></p><p>We will start by estimating the cost of driving 2700 miles in a comparable ICE car. Let‚Äôs start with the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>28 MPG for a car comparable to a Model 3</li><li>Average of $2.85 per gallon</li></ul><p>With those values, driving 2700 miles would cost about <strong>$275</strong> with a cost per mile of <strong>$0.10</strong>.<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">2700 miles / 28 miles per gallon = 96.4 gallons of gas</span><br><span class="line">96.4 gallons * $2.85 = $275</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Looking at the <a href="/data/ev-road-trip/">data from my road trip</a>, the total charging cost came to <strong>$98</strong> with a cost per mile of <strong>$0.04</strong>.</p><p>This comparison is not perfect, but gives us a good idea about the difference in cost. Keep in mind that cost will vary depending on how you drive and the price of fuel. The cost of electricity at Tesla Superchargers varies by location at a state-wide level and has <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/03/11/tesla-increases-cost-supercharger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occasional</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/18/tesla-increases-supercharger-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/22/tesla-cuts-supercharger-prices-back-down-customer-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjustments</a>.</p><p>Tesla has a useful calculator on their <a href="https://www.tesla.com/supercharger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> for comparing the cost of supercharging. There are also great tools for estimating the cost of an EV trip; my favorite being <a href="https://abetterrouteplanner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Better Routeplanner</a>.</p><h2 id="Ain‚Äôt-No-Mountain-High-Enough"><a href="#Ain‚Äôt-No-Mountain-High-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Ain‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough"></a>Ain‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough</h2><p>Driving through mountain passes in an electric car is one of the best driving experiences I have ever had. Much of this is due to <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/30/regenerative-braking-is-one-of-the-joys-of-driving-an-ev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regenerative braking</a>.</p><p>Every manufacturer of hybrid and fully-electric vehicles implements regenerative braking differently, so it is hard to generalize the experience across all EVs. The basic idea is that an electric motor in your vehicle can also act as a generator. When you want to slow down, this generator will start to convert the kinetic energy of your moving vehicle into electrical energy to charge the battery, slowing down the vehicle in the process. The ‚Äúwhen you want to slow down‚Äù is very different across vehicles. Some require the driver to use the brake pedal, a certain gear setting, or a stalk on the steering wheel.</p><p>In a Tesla, the only vehicle with regenerative braking that I have experience driving, all regenerative braking is controlled by the accelerator pedal. When you let off the accelerator, regenerative braking will be applied instead of letting the car coast. This allows you to precisely control the speed of the car by only using the accelerator pedal. The only time I use the brake pedal is when I come to a complete stop at intersections and when I need to slow down in a hurry.</p><p>So, how is this related to driving through mountain passes? Well, whenever you drive down a mountain or large hill in a ICE car, how do you drive differently? Maybe you downshift to lighten the load on your brakes? Perhaps you just keep your foot on the brake pedal, switching between coasting and braking throughout the descent?</p><p>For my car, the experience driving down a hill is the same as any other. No shifting, coasting, or <strong>even using the brake pedal</strong>. All I have to do is use the accelerator pedal to control precisely what speed I want to go. And thanks to regenerative braking, I do not even need to use the brake pedal when going down a steep mountain pass. I just let off the accelerator a little more than normal and that is it. Not only is an EV not using any energy when driving downhill, but it is actually <em>gaining</em> energy by recharging the battery. This often happens over long distances and without ever using the brake pedal.</p><p>There was a point in my trip where I averaged -10 watt hours per mile of energy consumption over five miles of driving.</p><img src="/ev-road-trip-for-the-fun-of-it/images/ev-downhill-regenerative-braking.jpg" title="[EV Regenerative Braking]"><p>The projected range was a comical 999 miles. Seems like Tesla needs to replace that with an ‚àû symbol.</p><p>Having precise control of downhill speed makes the driving experience down mountain passes a lot of fun. It was easy and safe to pass trucks and other slow vehicles, and fun to not have to slow down 20 miles per hour around corners thanks to the precise speed control and tremendous handling from the weight of the battery pack.</p><p>Of course, going _up_ mountain passes was fun, too. Again, it was easy to precisely control speed going up steep mountain passes. This time due mostly to tremendous horsepower, torque, and acceleration from the two electric motors. No shifting, awkward automatic transmission, or increase in engine noise. It really does not even feel like you are going uphill. You may even wonder why everyone else on the road has started to slow down so much.</p><h2 id="‚ÄúPlease-Turn-Off-Engine‚Äù"><a href="#‚ÄúPlease-Turn-Off-Engine‚Äù" class="headerlink" title="‚ÄúPlease Turn Off Engine‚Äù"></a>‚ÄúPlease Turn Off Engine‚Äù</h2><img src="/ev-road-trip-for-the-fun-of-it/images/no-idling.jpg" title="[Source https://www.roadtrafficsigns.com]"><p>I love coming across signs like this. I have experienced this before a number of times when waiting for a draw bridge or taking a ferry. I also experienced this again on my trip.</p><p>Idling sucks. It is a waist of fuel and pollutes harmful toxins in our air, often near places with heavy traffic and many pedestrians. You can turn off your engine when sitting in traffic to avoid idling. Or maybe your car will automatically do it for you. Neither of these are perfect solutions. Ask yourself: when sitting in traffic why don‚Äôt you turn your engine off? Maybe it is too inconvenient? Are you worried about not being able to turn it on back in time? What if your engine fails to start again? Having your car automatically turn the engine off isn‚Äôt the best solution either. If it was so great, why doesn‚Äôt everybody use it?</p><p>One more thing you don‚Äôt need to worry about if you drive an electric car. There is no engine to start and nothing to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù. It is just a simple switch from <em>park</em> to <em>drive</em>. If you are still worried about switching from park, just let the car ‚Äúhold‚Äù the brake for you. It is just a simple tap on the accelerator to continue moving forward.</p><p>On my way home from Colorado, I decided to drive through Yellowstone National Park. Unfortunately, there was a major car accident in the park as I was making my way through. Traffic came to a dead stop while the main road was closed down to one lane for a couple of hours.</p><p>We would end up sitting in one spot for ten to fifteen minutes before moving up a little at a time. The waits were long enough that everyone decided to turn their engines off, but short enough that drivers had to pay attention and be ready to turn on their engines at any time. There were always those one or two cars that were not ready in time and backed up traffic for a few car lengths. It didn‚Äôt really matter in the end, but it is the small things that count! Since I could switch to drive at a moment‚Äôs notice, I usually waited until two or three cars ahead started moving before switching.</p><p>It was the evening and still a little warm out. Most cars would leave windows unrolled and engines off, including myself. As the evening went on, the bugs started to come out. Eventually, I rolled up my windows and turned on the air conditioning. No problem. For the ICE cars, they had to compromise. They could continue to keep windows unrolled and deal with the mosquitoes. They could also roll the windows up and turn on the air conditioning and engine. Or they could roll up the windows, leave their engine off, turn on the fans and risk running their battery down.</p><p>This may not matter to everybody, but the little things add up. And when you are already in a stressful situation, like stuck in traffic in the middle of nowhere, one less decision to make goes a long way.</p><hr><p>This first post has gone over a few of the benefits of taking an EV on a road trip. I hope you have learned something new and are one step closer to being comfortable owning an EV.</p><p>There are a few other posts I have planned in this series that will cover some of the concerns surrounding electric vehicles, Tesla-specific features, and deep dives into nerdy, technical details. So stay tuned!</p><p>Questions or suggestions? Feel free to DM me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/codynhat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@codynhat</a>.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Why I Think Snapchat&#39;s Model is Flawed</title>

    <updated>2019-07-03T14:46:18.533Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/@codynhat/why-i-think-snapchats-model-is-flawed-c50998ffd590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></em></strong></p><p>A few days ago, a large amount of Snapchat photos and videos were leaked online in what is being called ‚ÄúThe Snappening.‚Äù Snapchat immediately sent out a statement saying they were not responsible for the leak and the blame should be set on third-party apps.</p><p>A third-party application named <em>Snapsaved</em> took responsibility, admitting their servers were breached and 500MB worth of images was accessed.</p><p>Ever since Snapchat has become popular, there have been a number of third-party applications built that use Snapchat‚Äôs API. Some of these apps allow Snapchat users to send and receive snaps on devices and platforms they normally couldn‚Äôt. Some of these apps, such as Snapsaved, allow users to download and save snaps without the sender knowing. This defeats the whole purpose of Snapchat, photos disappearing a few seconds after being viewed. This is also a big threat to the privacy of Snapchat‚Äôs users, which is why they are trying to get rid of any third-party apps that use their API.</p><p>An API, or Application Programming Interface, is what a mobile app uses to connect to the ‚Äúcloud,‚Äù or a company‚Äôs servers. It can be thought of as a web browser for computers. Instead of a human typing in a url like <em><a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://facebook.com</a></em> and getting back a nice looking web page, an API uses a url like <em><a href="http://api.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://api.facebook.com</a></em> and gets back a bunch of data. It then transforms or uses this data in a way that is useful to a user. The url an API uses is no different than the url a human uses when browsing the web. Because of this, a human could type in an API url if they wanted. All you would see is text that probably doesn‚Äôt make much sense.</p><p>Third-party apps do just this. They browse the internet using urls that are meant for computers and not humans.</p><p>This capability is perfectly fine in most cases, and in a lot of cases is even supported by companies. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow and encourage third-party apps to connect to their API. However, Snapchat does not.</p><p>The reason for this is obvious. Snapchat‚Äôs entire user experience centers around the idea that when you send a photo, it is only shown for a few seconds and then disappears forever. These photos are encrypted and stored on Snapchat‚Äôs servers. When someone views a snap, it is downloaded to their phone, shown for a few seconds, and then deleted from their phone and from Snapchat‚Äôs servers. Sounds simple, right? Problems arise when third-party apps start browsing Snapchat‚Äôs API. These apps can download photos with a user‚Äôs username and password, just like the Snapchat app. But once the photo is downloaded, Snapchat cannot guarantee that it gets deleted forever. In the case of Snapsaved, they save user‚Äôs photos on their servers.</p><p><em>Third-party apps that allow users to save the snaps they receive are the reason why thousands of photos have been leaked</em>.</p><p>This is the approach that Snapchat has taken when trying to explain the situation to the press and to their users. They are telling users to not trust any third-party apps that ask for your username and password. They have even started contacting Apple and Google to try and ban any third-party apps from being on their app stores.</p><p>But not all third-party apps are to blame.</p><p>A few months ago, I started working on a third-party Snapchat application for Mac OS X called Snappy. We realized that there was no way to view or send snaps from your computer. There was no Snapchat website or desktop app, only the mobile app.</p><p>We saw an opportunity.</p><p>Snappy was released to the Mac App Store in June of 2014. It allowed people to view snaps from their friends and send snaps using the built-in camera on their computers. You could also apply stylish and funny filters to your photos before sending them. Snappy did not allow you to save snaps and did not prevent snaps from disappearing. It worked exactly like Snapchat. The photos disappeared after they were shown.</p><img src="/why-i-think-snapchat-s-model-is-flawed/snappy.png" title="Snappy, Snap from your Mac"><p>We had no intention of interfering with Snapchat‚Äôs model or putting people‚Äôs privacy at risk; two things that other third-party apps do.</p><p>Instead, we wanted to enhance the experience of Snapchat by simply allowing people to use it on their computers. And we did this quite successfully.</p><p>Snappy peaked in the U.S. charts as the number three social networking app available to download. We exceeded our initial goal of downloads, set before even starting development. And we did this without spending a penny on marketing or advertising. (Actually, we wasted $10 on Facebook advertisements that only turned into a handful of downloads)</p><p>We have spent countless number of hours on Snappy. What started as a fun side project for a few college students turned into a project much larger and much more time demanding than we first anticipated.</p><p>With the recent events and press surrounding Snapchat‚Äôs leak, we decided to remove Snappy from the App Store.</p><p>Even though we had no involvement in the leak, we had one of the most popular Snapchat third-party apps and one of the only ones available for the Mac.</p><p>From the beginning, we only wanted to enhance the core experience of Snapchat. We decided that leaving Snappy on the App Store would only go against Snapchat‚Äôs wishes. We did not want to be in the middle of anything or contribute to ruining the experience of Snapchat. After all, this only started as a small side project.</p><p>So, I say to everyone aware of the recent Snapchat leak, do not put the blame on all third-party apps like Snapchat says.</p><p>Do not put the blame on Snapchat or their lack of security, but instead put the blame on their model. They thought they could make photos posted to the internet ‚Äúdisappear.‚Äù This seemed like a reality until third-party apps started going against Snapchat‚Äôs wishes and invading the privacy of their users.</p><p>To the third-party apps allowing people to save snaps, I say great job invading the privacy of millions of people. And thank you for making the countless hours we have put into Snappy come crashing down.</p><p>I hope it was worth it.</p>]]></content>
